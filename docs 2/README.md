# Docs — Start Here

This `docs/` folder is the **execution system** for building the project from scratch to final deliverables **without guessing**.

## One rule
If something is unclear, **do not guess**. Follow `WORKFLOW_START_HERE.md` → `CONFUSION_PROTOCOL.md`.

## Primary entry points
1. `WORKFLOW_START_HERE.md` — how to start a fresh build and finish
2. `AGENT_GENERAL_INSTRUCTIONS.md` — global rules (no drift, no redesign)
3. `PROJECT_SPEC_DEPENDENCIES.md` — required inputs & dependency check
4. `IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md` — milestone plan + gates (evidence required)
5. `DEFINITION_OF_DONE.md` — what “complete” means

## Index
See `00_INDEX.md`.
