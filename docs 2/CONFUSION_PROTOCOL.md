# Confusion Protocol (No Guessing)

When uncertain:
1) Write the unknown in one sentence.
2) Check sources in order:
   - Spec (pdf/docx)
   - Screenshots (docs/screens)
   - UI parity checklist
   - API contract + DB schema
   - Existing code search
3) If still unclear: STOP and add to `OPEN_QUESTIONS.md`.
4) Implement configurable solution (Rule Engine) rather than hardcoding.
5) Once clarified: append to `DECISIONS.md`.
